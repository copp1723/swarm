- Removed hardcoded credentials
- Updated dependencies (openai, anthropic)
- Security headers on all responses
- JWT support preparation

### 3. **Performance Enhancements**
Documentation covers:
- Connection pooling benefits
- Cached thread pool executors
- Lazy loading patterns
- Response caching strategies

### 4. **Development Workflow**
Clear guidance on:
- Using `requirements-dev.txt`
- Pre-commit hooks setup
- Testing with pytest
- Code formatting with black
- Linting with flake8/pylint
