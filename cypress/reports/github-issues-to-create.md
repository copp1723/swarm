## Issue #1: [HIGH PRIORITY] Backend Database Configuration Blocking QA Testing

**Title:** `[HIGH PRIORITY] Database Configuration Issues Blocking QA Testing`  
**Labels:** `bug`, `high-priority`, `backend`, `database`, `qa-blocker`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Issue Description

During cross-browser QA testing, discovered critical database configuration issues that prevent the Flask application from starting properly.

## Error Details

```
sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file
Critical error during database initialization
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils.decorators'
```

## Impact

- ❌ Full application functionality blocked
- ❌ Backend API endpoints inaccessible  
- ❌ Chat functionality testing incomplete
- ❌ File upload testing impossible

## Environment

- **Browser:** All (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Viewport:** All (1440px, 1024px, 390px)
- **Test Suite:** Cross-browser & Viewport QA
- **Framework:** Flask + SQLite

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start Flask application with `python app.py`
2. Observe database initialization errors
3. Application fails to start properly

## Expected Behavior

- Flask app should start without database errors
- All API endpoints should be accessible
- Database should initialize with proper schema

## Files Affected

- `app.py` - Main application file
- `utils/db_init.py` - Database initialization
- `routes/agents.py` - Missing decorators import
- Database configuration files

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Database Path Configuration**
   - Ensure SQLite database directory exists
   - Verify database file permissions
   - Check database connection string

2. **Resolve Missing Dependencies**
   - Fix `utils.decorators` import error
   - Verify all required modules are available
   - Check Python path configuration

3. **Database Schema Initialization**
   - Ensure proper database schema creation
   - Test database migrations
   - Verify table creation scripts

## Priority

**HIGH** - Blocks all functional testing and QA validation

## Issue #2: [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Missing File Upload Interface Component

**Title:** `[MEDIUM PRIORITY] File Upload Interface Not Implemented - QA Testing Blocked`  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `medium-priority`, `frontend`, `file-upload`, `qa-needed`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Issue Description

Cross-browser QA testing revealed that the file upload functionality is completely missing from the UI. No file upload interface, buttons, or input fields are present.

## Current State

- ❌ No visible file upload interface
- ❌ No file upload buttons or drag-drop areas
- ❌ Cannot test file upload functionality across browsers
- ❌ Feature mentioned in requirements but not implemented

## Expected Implementation

- ✅ File upload input field or drag-drop area
- ✅ File type restrictions and validation
- ✅ Upload progress indicators
- ✅ File size limits and error handling
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Testing Requirements

Once implemented, needs testing across:
- **Desktop (1440px):** Full drag-drop functionality
- **Tablet (1024px):** Touch-friendly file selection
- **Mobile (390px):** Mobile-optimized file picker

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File upload component visible in UI
- [ ] Supports common file types (txt, pdf, images)
- [ ] Works across all target browsers
- [ ] Responsive design for all viewport sizes
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Integration with backend file processing

## Priority

**MEDIUM** - Core feature missing, affects user workflow

## Issue #3: [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Collaboration Modal Incomplete Implementation

**Title:** `[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Collaboration Modal Missing Content and Functionality`  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `medium-priority`, `frontend`, `modal`, `collaboration`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Issue Description

The collaboration modal button exists and is clickable, but the modal content and functionality are incomplete. This prevents proper testing of multi-agent collaboration features.

## Current State

- ✅ "Multi-Agent Task" button visible and styled
- ✅ Button responds to clicks across all viewports
- ⚠️ Modal container exists but is empty
- ❌ No modal content or functionality
- ❌ Cannot test collaboration workflows

## Missing Components

- Modal content area with proper structure
- Agent selection interface
- Task configuration options
- Progress tracking display
- Modal close functionality (X button, ESC key)
- Backend integration for collaboration API

## Cross-Browser Testing Status

| Viewport | Button Visible | Button Functional | Modal Content |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1440px   | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| 1024px   | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| 390px    | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Expected Implementation

- Complete modal UI with proper layout
- Agent selection and configuration interface
- Real-time collaboration status updates
- Proper modal behavior (open/close, overlay, focus management)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Responsive design for all viewport sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Modal opens with complete content
- [ ] Modal can be closed via X button and ESC key
- [ ] Content is responsive across all viewports
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Integration with collaboration backend
- [ ] Loading states and error handling

## Priority

**MEDIUM** - Important feature for multi-agent workflows

## Issue #4: [LOW PRIORITY] Mobile Layout Optimization Needed

**Title:** `[LOW PRIORITY] Minor Mobile Layout Issues at 390px Viewport`  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `low-priority`, `mobile`, `responsive`, `css`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Issue Description

Minor layout optimization issues detected during mobile testing at 390px viewport. While the interface is functional, there are small improvements needed for optimal mobile experience.

## Issues Identified

### Layout Overflow
- Minor horizontal overflow detected on some screens
- Content occasionally extends beyond viewport width
- Scrolling experience could be improved

### Typography Optimization  
- Text could be larger for better mobile readability
- Line height could be optimized for smaller screens
- Font scaling could be improved

### Touch Target Optimization
- Some interactive elements could be larger for better touch interaction
- Spacing between clickable elements could be increased
- Mobile-first design principles could be better applied

## Browser Testing Results

- **Chrome Mobile (390px):** ⚠️ Minor issues detected
- **Safari Mobile:** Needs testing once backend is fixed
- **Firefox Mobile:** Needs testing once backend is fixed

## Current Mobile Experience

- ✅ Mobile menu button works correctly
- ✅ Sidebar accessible via mobile navigation
- ✅ Basic responsive behavior functional
- ⚠️ Layout could be optimized
- ⚠️ Typography could be improved

## Recommended Improvements

1. **CSS Layout Fixes**
   - Review viewport units and responsive breakpoints
   - Fix horizontal overflow issues
   - Optimize spacing for mobile screens

2. **Typography Enhancements**
   - Increase base font size for mobile
   - Improve line height for readability
   - Optimize heading sizes for small screens

3. **Touch Target Optimization**
   - Ensure 44px minimum touch targets
   - Increase spacing between interactive elements
   - Improve mobile-specific hover states

## Priority

**LOW** - Interface is functional, but could be improved for better UX
