# SWARM Multi-Agent AI Platform  
**Feature & Functionality Guide**

---

## 1. Executive Summary
SWARM is an enterprise-ready automation platform that turns inbound messages and data streams into **actionable work**, executed by a team of specialized AI agents (Product, Coding, QA, Security, DevOps, and more).  
It delivers:

* Autonomous task triage, routing, and completion  
* Real-time transparency through rich dashboards and audit trails  
* Plug-and-play extensibility for new skills, data sources, and workflows  
* Production-grade security, persistence, and observability

**Business Impact Example**  
A warranty-claim email is received at 9 AM. Within minutes SWARM:  
1. Verifies authenticity & parses requirements  
2. Assigns Product + Coding + QA agents  
3. Generates fix PR, test plan, and customer reply draft  
4. Provides an auditable timeline—all without human touch.

## 4. Technical Capabilities & Architecture
* **Language & Frameworks**: Python 3.11, Flask, Flask-SocketIO (gevent), React-like static frontend  
* **AI Providers via OpenRouter**: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini-Pro, Llama 3, etc. (per-agent model selection)  
* **Persistence**: PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy ORM, Redis caching  
* **Task Orchestration**: Celery workers for async workloads  
* **Real-Time Transport**: WebSocket with graceful HTTP polling fallback  
* **Filesystem Access**: Secure MCP sandbox for code/file manipulation  
* **Plugin System**: ServicePlugin interface, hot-reload with watchdog  
* **Observability**: Loguru structured logs, Prometheus metrics, Sentry hooks  
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Dockerfile & production_setup.sh for Ubuntu 22.04
