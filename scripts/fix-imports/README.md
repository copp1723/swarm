# Path Alias Import Error Solution

This directory contains scripts to solve the **~100+ path alias import errors** in the JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## Problem

The build system is reporting path alias errors, but after analysis, the JavaScript files in `/static/js` are already using proper relative imports. The errors might be coming from:

1. TypeScript expecting path aliases that aren't configured
2. Build tools looking for alias configurations
3. Test files or other JavaScript files outside the main source directory
4. False positives from the build system

## Solution Scripts

### 1. `analyze-imports.js`
Analyzes all JavaScript/TypeScript files and reports:
- Total import statements
- Import patterns (relative, alias, module)
- Problematic imports that need fixing
- Missing files or misconfigured paths

### 2. `fix-imports.js`
Automatically fixes import issues by:
- Converting path aliases (@/, ~/) to relative imports
- Adding missing .js extensions for ES modules
- Ensuring all imports resolve correctly

### 3. `solve-import-errors.js`
Interactive tool that provides multiple strategies:
- **Strategy 1**: Convert all imports to relative paths (recommended)
- **Strategy 2**: Configure build tools for path aliases
- **Strategy 3**: Create import maps for browser ES modules

## Usage

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/swarm/mcp_new_project
node scripts/fix-imports/solve-import-errors.js
```

Then select option 1 to convert all imports to relative paths.

### Manual Analysis

```bash
# Analyze current import state
node scripts/fix-imports/analyze-imports.js

# Fix imports automatically
node scripts/fix-imports/fix-imports.js
```

## Path Alias Configuration

If you want to keep using path aliases, the following configurations have been added:

### TypeScript Configuration (`/static/tsconfig.json`)
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["js/*"],
      "@components/*": ["js/components/*"],
      "@services/*": ["js/services/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["js/utils/*"],
      "@agents/*": ["js/agents/*"],
      "~/*": ["js/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported Path Aliases
- `@/` → `/static/js/`
- `@components/` → `/static/js/components/`
- `@services/` → `/static/js/services/`
- `@utils/` → `/static/js/utils/`
- `@agents/` → `/static/js/agents/`
- `~/` → `/static/js/`

## Verification

After running the fix:

1. Run the analysis again to verify all issues are resolved:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-imports/analyze-imports.js
   ```

2. Run your build command to ensure no import errors remain:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes

- All scripts preserve your original code structure
- Import fixes maintain the same module resolution
- The scripts handle ES6 imports, CommonJS requires, and dynamic imports
- File backups are recommended before running fixes

## Troubleshooting

If errors persist after running the fixes:

1. Check for imports in HTML files or inline scripts
2. Look for bundled/compiled files that might have old imports
3. Clear build caches and rebuild
4. Check if the errors are coming from node_modules (which we don't modify)

## Report

After analysis, a detailed report is saved to:
`scripts/fix-imports/import-analysis-report.json`

This contains all problematic imports found and can be used for manual review.
